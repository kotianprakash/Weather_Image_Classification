# Weather Image Classification with Regularization

## Introduction

This project aims to classify images of weather conditions using regularization techniques such as Dropout and L2 regularization. The idea is to train a model that can accurately classify images of weather conditions based on their visual features, while also preventing overfitting through the use of regularization.

## Algorithm

The algorithm used to classify weather images into different categories is based on a CNN with regularization techniques such as Dropout and L2 regularization. Here's how it works:

The program reads in images of weather conditions from the weather dataset.

The program applies various image processing techniques to enhance the features of the images.

The program trains a CNN on the training set with regularization techniques such as Dropout and L2 regularization to learn the features of different weather conditions.

The program evaluates the performance of the model on the testing set by comparing its predictions with the true labels of the images.

The program uses the trained model to predict the categories of sample images from the testing set.

## Conclusion

Weather image classification with regularization is a powerful technique for automatically classifying images of weather conditions. This project demonstrates how CNNs with regularization techniques such as Dropout and L2 regularization can be used to learn the features of different weather conditions and accurately classify them into different categories, while also preventing overfitting. With further development and refinement, this technique could be used in real-world applications such as weather forecasting or disaster management.
